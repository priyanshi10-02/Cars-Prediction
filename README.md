# Cars Prediction 

This is a python project based on Machine Learning.
Here I have used Supervised Machine Learning technique
based on Classification.

Classification is a process of categorizing data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes.

Out of several Classification techniques available I have used GaussianNB and Support Vector Classifier.

GaussianNB-
GNB is a classification technique used in Machine Learning (ML) based on the probabilistic approach and Gaussian distribution. Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that each parameter has an independent capacity of predicting the output variable.
Accuracy-78.22%

Support Vector Classifier-
SVC works by mapping data points to a high-dimensional space and then finding the optimal hyperplane that divides the data into two classes.
Accuracy-92.29%
